# Deep Learning Problems

This repository contains various deep learning homework problems that I have worked on. The projects demonstrate different aspects of neural networks, generative models, and object detection techniques.

## Contents

- **`GAN.ipynb`**: Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data. Includes explanations and code for building and training GAN models.
  
- **`neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb`**: A step-by-step guide to building a neural network from scratch using Python, covering key concepts and implementing a fully functional model without any high-level frameworks.

- **`object_detection.ipynb`**: Homework problems focused on object detection, including the implementation of basic object detection models and evaluation metrics.


## How to Use

To explore the projects, clone the repository and open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdzahidul-islam/deep_learning_homework.git
